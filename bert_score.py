# BERTScore:
# Instead of checking exact words, BERTScore uses a language model (like BERT) to check meaning similarity.
# Even if your candidate uses different numbers/words but keeps the meaning, BERTScore will give high score.
# Much better for chatbots, QA systems, and real-world responses.

reference = ["You likely consumed around 400â€“700 calories, maybe more depending on what else was inside and how big it was."]
candidate = ["According to the provided context, a Burrito with cheese only has approximately 328 calories."]

# Compute BERTScore
